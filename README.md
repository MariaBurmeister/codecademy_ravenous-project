# ravenous-a-yelp-like-react-project_codecademy
This is a **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) Project** using React.



This Project accompanyies the learning of **React** and consists of **many parts**.

In **[Part I](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/front-end-applications-with-react/modules/react-development-setup-and-ravenous-part-1/projects/create-prj-components)**, I used **npx create-react-app** to create a **boilerplate React application**.

I had to follow a step by step to **add component directories**, aswell as **write the components** and **rewrite the main App.js component**.

**CSS was completely provided by codecademy**, and not written by me.

Part II and following have not yet been started.
